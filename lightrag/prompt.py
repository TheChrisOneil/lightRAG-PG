Given a text document about high school student development and a list of entity types from the High School Student Development Ontology (HSSDO), identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
Use {language} as output language.
---HSSDO Entity Type Guidelines---
When identifying entities, ensure they align with the HSSDO ontological framework:
identity_entity: Self-concept, values clarification, cultural identity, personal vision, authentic expression, identity integration

Examples: Personal Vision Development, Values Clarification, Self Awareness, Cultural Identity Exploration, Authentic Expression

academic_entity: Educational performance, learning strategies, intellectual growth, study skills, college readiness

Examples: Academic Performance, Study Skills, Intellectual Curiosity, Critical Thinking, College Readiness, Learning Optimization

emotional_entity: Emotional intelligence, self-regulation, social awareness, relationship management, stress resilience

Examples: Self Regulation, Empathy Development, Social Awareness, Emotional Coping, Anxiety Management, Mood Management

physical_entity: Physical health, fitness, energy management, body awareness, health habits

Examples: Physical Fitness, Health Habits, Energy Management, Body Awareness, Sleep Hygiene, Nutritional Wellness

cognitive_entity: Mental processes, thinking patterns, executive function, attention control, memory, creative thinking

Examples: Executive Function, Attention Control, Memory Capacity, Creative Thinking, Problem Solving, Time Management

social_entity: Interpersonal relationships, communication skills, community engagement, peer relationships, social presence

Examples: Communication Skills, Peer Relationships, Community Engagement, Social Presence, Conflict Resolution, Team Building

family_system_entity: Family dynamics, parental engagement, cultural influences, socioeconomic factors

Examples: Parent Guardian Engagement, Cultural Influences, Family Dynamics, Socioeconomic Factors, Family Communication Patterns

community_entity: Community context, school environment, neighborhood factors, community resources

Examples: School Environment, Community Resources, Neighborhood Factors, Peer Culture, Extracurricular Opportunities

risk_awareness_entity: Risk management, substance awareness, digital safety, crisis prevention

Examples: Substance Awareness, Digital Safety, Sexual Health Education, Cyberbullying Prevention

life_skills_entity: Practical skills, financial literacy, career development, independent living preparation

Examples: Financial Literacy, Career Development, Money Management, Work Readiness, Consumer Skills

---HSSDO Relationship Types---
Use these relationship types that reflect how student development entities influence each other:
ENHANCES (0.5-0.9): Improves or amplifies another entity
SUPPORTS (0.4-0.8): Provides foundation for another entity
ENABLES (0.6-0.9): Makes another entity possible or easier
CAUSES (0.7-1.0): Direct causation between entities
INFLUENCES (0.5-0.8): Affects development of another entity
INHIBITS (0.5-0.9): Suppresses or reduces another entity
COMPETES (0.4-0.7): Creates competition for resources
UNDERMINES (0.5-0.8): Weakens foundation of another entity
SYNERGIZES (0.7-1.0): Combined effect greater than sum of parts
CONSTRAINS (0.4-0.8): External factor that limits development
FACILITATES (0.5-0.9): External factor that makes development easier
---Steps---

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:


entity_name: Name of the entity that aligns with HSSDO subclasses (e.g., "Values Clarification" not "career goals"). Use same language as input text. If English, capitalize first letter of each word.
entity_type: One of the HSSDO entity types: [{entity_types}]
entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities as they relate to student development
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)


From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other according to student development principles.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:


source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
relationship_type: one of the HSSDO relationship types listed above
relationship_description: explanation of how the source entity influences the target entity in student development context
relationship_keywords: high-level keywords summarizing the developmental relationship
relationship_strength: numeric score (0.0-1.0) indicating relationship strength within the specified range for the relationship type
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_type>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)


Identify high-level keywords that summarize the main student development concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. Focus on developmental domains and growth areas.
Format the content-level keywords as ("content_keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)
Return output in {language} as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use {record_delimiter} as the list delimiter.
When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

---Quality Checks---
Before finalizing output, verify:

All entity names align with HSSDO ontological subclasses
All relationship types are from the approved HSSDO list
Relationship strengths fall within specified ranges
Entities represent actual student development phenomena from the text
Relationships reflect authentic developmental connections
DO NOT include an entity in the relationships if it was not identified in step 1
DO NOT include relationships that do not have a source and target entity not identified from step 1
DO NOT include relationships that do not have a relationship type from the HSSDO list
